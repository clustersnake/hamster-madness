## Mechanics
- The player will collect hamster balls randomly placed in the game board.

- The player will be able to shoot the hamster ball at any time in the direction the player is facing.
- Can make charged shots that use extra balls.
- Can make parrys that won't deplete the current shield.
- The player may drop the hamster ball and use it as a land mine in any time, the land mine may be shot in any direction the player is facing or can be dropped in the place occupied by the player.
- The more hamster balls are being collected, the more the tail will grow.
- The player can collide with the balls line but will lose two balls, one for the shield and one for the ball being hit.
- The remaining balls left after being hit by the player can be recovered by the player.
- The mines and shoots can cut the "snake's" body at any time and missing balls can be recovered by the player.
